When designing systems, I always start with a principle:
**Speed to market first, but with patterns that allow for future scaling.**

Why this matters:

- MVP must be simple and quick to deliver.
- Scaling later should not mean painful rewrites.
- Early design choices (like modularization, observability, and automation) give room to grow without blocking the business.

This balance between _speed_ and _scalability_ is what I call the **architect’s role in practice**: enabling the team to deliver now, while protecting tomorrow’s flexibility.
