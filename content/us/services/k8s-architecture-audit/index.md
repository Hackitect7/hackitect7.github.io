## Who is this service for

Teams running Kubernetes (managed or self-hosted) that need **reliability, security**, and **cost control** — without guesswork or vendor buzz.

---

## Problems we solve

- Unclear platform ownership, noisy alerts, long MTTR
- Inconsistent IaC/GitOps, mutable clusters, snowflake nodes
- Risky defaults: weak RBAC/PSPs/PodSecurity, open egress, misconfigured ingress
- Cost spikes due to overprovisioning, no requests/limits SLO coupling
- Observability gaps: no SLO/SLI, missing golden signals, ineffective runbooks

---

## What you get (deliverables)

- **Executive summary** for leadership: risks, business impact, quick wins
- **Technical report** with a severity-ranked backlog (High/Medium/Low)
- **Architecture diagrams** (current vs. target)
- **30–60–90 day roadmap** with owners, estimates, and acceptance criteria

---

## How it works (process)

1. **Discovery & access** — short intake, read-only access, non-invasive data collection
2. **Architecture & ops review** — cluster policies, namespaces, network, storage, backups, images, registries
3. **Observability & incident response** — SLO/SLI, alerts, on-call, MTTR, dashboards, runbooks
4. **Security & hardening** — RBAC, secrets, admission, supply chain
5. **Cost & capacity** — rightsizing, autoscaling, bin-packing, FinOps KPIs
6. **Report & roadmap** — executive brief + detailed backlog + rollout plan

---

## Typical outcomes (metrics)

- **MTTR ↓ 30–60%**, **alert noise ↓ 40–70%**
- **Infra spend ↓ 10–35%** via rightsizing and scheduling
- **Change failure rate ↓**, **deploys/week ↑** with GitOps/IaC hygiene

---

## Optional add-ons

- Implementation support (pairing/coaching)
- Incident response & chaos drills
- Platform enablement workshops for teams

## FAQ

**What access do you need?**
Read-only access to clusters/CI and selected repos; screen shares if access is limited.

**Can you include multi-cluster/multi-region?**
Yes. We cover traffic shaping, failover, backups, and recovery objectives.

**Do you support regulated environments (PCI/SOC2/ISO)?**
Yes — controls are mapped to your compliance baseline.
