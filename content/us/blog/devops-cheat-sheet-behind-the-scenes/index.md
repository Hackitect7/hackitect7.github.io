The **DevOps Cheat Sheet** project is not just a static page â€” itâ€™s a living, multilingual knowledge base.

Some highlights of how itâ€™s built:

- Quarto for flexible content authoring
- YAML dictionaries for localization into 27 languages
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD and automatic builds

This mix allows me to maintain consistency across all translations, while keeping the content modular and easy to extend.
